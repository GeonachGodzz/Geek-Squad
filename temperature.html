        <h2>Hot VS Cold</h2>
        <p>In our experiment, we tested how different GPU temperatures affect the frame rate of a game by using different GPU fan speeds.<br> 
            The goal was to understand whether cooling plays a role in maintaining stable performance during gameplay.</p>
        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p> We ran the game at two different GPU fan speeds; one at the <strong>minimum fan speed</strong> and the other at the <strong>maximum fan speed</strong> 
            resulting in two different temperatures which enabled us to carry out this experiment. The results showed a <strong>clear difference in performance</strong>.</p>

                At <strong>lower temperatures</strong>, the frame rate was <strong>higher</strong> and remained <strong>consistent</strong> throughout the session.There were <strong>
                    no major dips</strong> or stutters, and the gameplay felt smooth<br>

                When testing the two scenarios, what we manipulated in the experiment was the <strong>GPU fan speed</strong>; 
                increasing airflow should lower down the overall temperature of the GPU;<br>However, when tested in Valorant, the <strong>end temperature of the GPU</strong> 
                came up to around the <strong>SAME TEMPERATURE</strong> while running the game, but the <strong>starting temperature of the GPU</strong>
                when fan speed was at a 100% was much <strong>lower</strong> compared to <strong>minimum fan speed</strong>
