        <h2>Ram Performance Comparison</h2>
        <div id="introduction">
            <p>When it comes to building a computer, the RAM is one of the most considered components. Most people know that the higher the RAM generally means better multitasking performance; does the <strong>RAM type and brand</strong> matter in this case? <br><br> To explore this, we tested the load up time for games, using 3 PC's, with 16GB of RAM installed in all of them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="Test Setup">
            <h3 style="color: #00bcd4;">Test Setup</h3>
            <p>We used three computers with the following RAM specifications.</p>
            <ul class = "offset">
                <li><strong>PC 1:</strong> 16 GB DDR4 RAM (Kingston Fury)</li>
                <li><strong>PC 2:</strong> 16 GB DDR4 RAM (Apacer Nox)</li>
                <li><strong>PC 3:</strong> 16 GB DDR5 RAM (Samsung)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id="observation">
            <h3 style="color: #00bcd4;">Observation: Load up time</h3>
            <p> Our main focus was the <strong>load-up time</strong> - how fast each computer could load up a video game; in this case <strong>Fortnite</strong><br><br>Here's what we observed:</p>
            <ul class = "offset">
                <li><strong>PC 1 and PC 2</strong> (both with DDR4 RAM) had identical load times, despite not being the same brand</li>
                <li><strong>PC 3</strong> (with DDR5 RAM) also performed well, with much better load up time compared to the DDR4 RAM, so we focused on the comparison between the two DDR4 RAM</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Key Points</h2>
    <div class="comparison-section">
        <div id="key-points">
            
            <p>
                The computer equipped with DDR5 RAM had a <strong>much faster load up time</strong> compared to the two systems using DDR4 RAM - even though all three had the same capacity of 16 GB.
                <br> The brand of DDR4 RAM made no difference: both DDR4 systems performed exactly the same. However, the generation of RAM did make a clear impact in the results.
            </p>
            <p><strong>This tells us two things:</strong></p>
            <ol class="offset">
                <li><strong>RAM generation matters more than brand</strong>, especially when comparing <strong>DDR4</strong> vs <strong>DDR5</strong></li>
                <li><strong>DDR5 provides improved performance in everyday use</strong> even in basic tasks like loading programs</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <p>Here's a comparison of the load up times in a graph:</p>
