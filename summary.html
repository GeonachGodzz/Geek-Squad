    <h1>Project Summary</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Research Findings</h2>

    <p>Do different games impact component temperatures differently?</p>
    <p>
        Yes. Depending on games, especially those with high-resolution graphics will generally require more processing power from the CPU and GPU,
        leading to higher temperatures than less demanding games.
    </p>

    <h2>How does integrated graphics (on a CPU) compare to a dedicated GPU in terms of performance for heavy gaming?</h2>
    <p>
        For most modern games, especially those with high-fidelity graphics, the GPU plays a dominant role in determining performance.
        A powerful GPU can render more detailed textures, handle complex lighting effects, and maintain higher frame rates,
        all of which contribute to a smoother, more immersive gaming experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Overall Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Through collaborative effort, our group of three successfully investigated the topic “Which hardware is most suitable for optimal gaming performance”
        by combining rigorous research, critical analysis, and effective communication. Key findings from our discussions included:
        “How does the temperature of components affect performance across different games?” and
        “Do games run better on Microsoft OS or Linux OS?”

        We faced several challenges, such as determining which component temperatures have the greatest impact across different games,
        correctly setting up hard drives in Linux, and understanding how the performance of a CPU’s integrated GPU compares
        to a mid-range dedicated GPU (e.g., RTX 4050) in heavy games.

        Our team dynamic, marked by equitable task delegation and open dialogue, enabled us to synthesize diverse perspectives into cohesive outcomes.
        This project has been an incredibly rewarding experience, especially due to the privilege of collaborating with such dedicated teammates since April.
        Your hard work, efficiency, and positive attitude made every discussion and challenge worthwhile.

        While this marks the end of our project, the lessons we've learned and the teamwork we’ve built will continue to benefit us in future endeavors.
